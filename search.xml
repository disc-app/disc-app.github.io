<p>You can use the Disc web app as well as IOS app to create posts for places. In particular, you can select a floor for a post, and the DiscPlaces IOS and Android apps will display your post for the appropriate floor.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve created posts for each of the rooms in the British Museum. Here’s an example of a post for the room with the Parthenon exhibit.<br><img src="/images/room-18-bm-med.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Check out (/discplaces)[DiscPlaces] for examples of how you can overlay posts on Google indoor maps, as well as search for posts.</p>
<h4 id="Adding_an_indoor_map_to_Google_Maps"><a href="#Adding_an_indoor_map_to_Google_Maps" class="headerlink" title="Adding an indoor map to Google Maps"></a>Adding an indoor map to Google Maps</h4><p>Google has support for user-contributed indoor maps, but the process is somewhat confusing. </p>
<ul>
<li>Start at <a href="https://maps.google.com/floorplans/find?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Floorplans</a></li>
<li>Choose a place <img src="images/indoor-map-1.png" width="400px/"></li>
<li>Add some meta-information and upload your map <img src="images/indoor-map-2.png" width="400px/"></li>
<li>Line up your map<img src="images/indoor-map-3.png" width="400px/"></li>
<li>Submit for review, and be prepared to wait for several weeks<br>The restrictions on indoor maps seem fairly lenient, the primary one being the map has to be of a public place.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Creating_indoor_maps"><a href="#Creating_indoor_maps" class="headerlink" title="Creating indoor maps"></a>Creating indoor maps</h4><p>I did a couple of test maps, using graphic designers I found on Odesk. It was a fairly painless experience, thanks to the competence and cooperation of Alex Frantiuc and Hamo Hapic. Here’s what we created, you can compare with the starting specification.</p>
<ul>
<li>HEB grocery store: <a href="/images/heb-start.pdf">starting point</a>, <a href="/images/heb-final.pdf">final result</a></li>
<li>Texas Natural History Museum: <a href="/images/museum-all-floors.pdf">starting point</a>, <a href="/images/texas-museum-map.pdf">final result</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s notes from Alex on the methodology he followed. Basically, we tried to mimic the floor plan for the British Museum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Used software: ArcMap 10.3, Adobe Illustrator 2015 CC and Adobe Acrobat XI Pro.<br>The most used software was ArcMap. </li>
<li>To simply put it I digitized the plan. Here is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dY3x-5qX6U" target="_blank" rel="external">example</a></li>
<li>The color was also taken in ArcMap from the British Museum example that you gave me. Loaded the image until pixel level and the software has a tool that can tell the RGB composition of certain pixels.</li>
<li>The font was taken from a description of British Museum floor plans. I wasn’t sure about it. I went with the idea of testing it, as example, wasn’t set on using sans serif. But you did liked it and as long as it fits your needs it was good for me.:)</li>
<li>Illustrator was used to convert the icon from svg to emf, because ArcMap doesn’t accept that format.</li>
<li>Acrobat was used as visualization tool and to bind the pdfs together. The transparency was also set here. Access ctrl+k, go to page display and check the show transparency grid box and that’s all.</li>
<li>Related to the scale, one work around would be the make the page greater then an A4 format. </li>
<li>The solution would be to draw them to scale.If you’ll look into the lower right corner of the pdf document that you have sent to me there is written “2/07” and I assume that is the scale.</li>
<li>For the next project I’ll try to do it in AutoCAD, as ArcMap is not made for indoor floor plans.</li>
</ul>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beacons are devices that transmit bluetooth signals that your mobile phone can detect. They are small (similar to a thick coin) and low-energy (lasting 2-24 months on a battery) with a range of 10-100 feet.</p>
<p>They are nice because</p>
<ul>
<li>your phone can detect them in buildings, where it would be otherwise hard to get an accurate GPS fix, and</li>
<li>an app can generated a notification on detecting a beacon, e.g., “Welcome to HEB, Specials on Aisle 1”</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve put together an extension of DiscPlaces which uses these features. This app is called DiscHyper - it’s currently available for IOS; an Android client is undergoing debugging, and should be available soon.<br>Click <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dischyper/id1082149262?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> to download it.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy beacons, you can use the Disc webapp to create content for your beacons. You use the app to specify the beacon’s configuration (technically the UUID, major and minor ids) as well as the beacon content (location, text, images, and alert message, if desired). You can also use the DiscApp IOS client to create/edit your beacons. Then you configure the beacon (usually using an app from the beacon vendor on your phone), and are set.</p>
<p>Technically, DiscHyper tells the phone OS to notify it when you come in range of a beacon. We then send this list of beacons along with place/search text when you do a search - knowledge of the beacons you have recently discovered helps us better identify where you are (e.g., which floor of the British Musuem). You can also enable alerts, i.e., the messages that pop up in your phone when you come in range of a beacon.</p>
<p>Note that you don’t have to have DiscHyper in the foreground for beacon discovery to work - the OS will automatically notify DiscHyper when it discovers beacons.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Introducing Disc]]></title>
      <url>http://www.disc-app.com/disc-intro/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DiscApp is a tool for facilitating writing about places. Specifically, it’s tailored to let you easily create personal and group narratives.  It does this by suggesting tags to add to your posts - these tags are based on tags you’ve used in the past, the place and time you are writing about, and commonly used tags.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re vacationing in Iceland, and are posting daily updates of your trip to Facebook, you can use the tag <code>#AdnanIceland2016</code>. DiscApp will then suggest that tag for future posts about that region. It will also suggest that tag to others, such as family members on the trip, who are creating posts about the same trip - this knits all posts about the event into a common theme.  </p>
<h4 id="Tagging_with_DiscApp_3A"><a href="#Tagging_with_DiscApp_3A" class="headerlink" title="Tagging with DiscApp:"></a>Tagging with DiscApp:</h4><ul>
<li>You can use multiple tags with a post, e.g., <code>#AdnanEurope2016</code>, <code>#AdnanIceland2016</code>, <code>#GulflossWaterfalls</code>.</li>
<li>You can choose the place and time you are writing about directly using the embedded map place picker.  Alternatively, DiscApp can suggest places and times based on the images you choose.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Additional_features_3A"><a href="#Additional_features_3A" class="headerlink" title="Additional features:"></a>Additional features:</h4><ul>
<li>Disc works even in the absence of an Internet connection - if you are travelling, and don’t have access to the Internet, e.g., are in a plane, a remote place, or roaming data is very expensive, you can create and save content to your phone.</li>
<li>You can add upto 16 pictures at a time to your post; the total number of pictures is unlimited.</li>
<li>You can search Google images from DiscApp and add those images to your post with a long press of them.</li>
<li>With one click, you can copy the content of your post to paste into any other IOS app.</li>
<li>Your posts are stored at the Disc server, and you can share a link to them, e.g., via Facebook and Twitter. </li>
<li>Disc allows you to view images in several ways:<ul>
<li>All on one pages, fit carefully to optimized screen space</li>
<li>As a gallery and contact sheet that you swipe throught. </li>
<li>As thumbnails overlaid on a map.</li>
<li>A slider control on the map let’s you see the images sorted by timestamp. </li>
<li>Disc performs clustering, i.e., if there are many images in one part of the map, it’ll show with a cluster marker, which you can zoom to, or click on to expand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Getting_DiscApp"><a href="#Getting_DiscApp" class="headerlink" title="Getting DiscApp"></a>Getting DiscApp</h2><p>You can download the IOS app from the App Store, or use the web app, linked <a href="http://disc-app.com" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can use DiscApp to create content for another tool I’ve written - DiscPlaces.  DiscPlaces let’s you view posts for a place, as well as search for content assoicated with a place. Read more about it (/discplaces)[here].</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DiscApp is a tool for writing about places. In particular, when used in conjunction with the DiscPlaces IOS and Android apps, it makes these places highly searchable. A museum, a college campus, an amusement park, a zoo - these are all good examples of applications of DiscApp.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can use DiscApp: you can use the web application, or the IOS application.

      <title><![CDATA[Customized DiscPlaces]]></title>
      <url>http://www.disc-app.com/discplaces-custom/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The DiscPlaces mobie app itself is very simple, the smarts, namely scalability, and contextual search, come from the server. You can create content for DiscPlaces using the DiscApp IOS and WebApp.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you can request a Disc API key, and use that when creating content. This allows you to limit content to the content that you have created. You can use our API to add hyperlocal search to your app. For example, if you are a grocery store, you can add the  capabilities of DiscPlaces to let your customers search your store.  In  addition to our API, you can use the open source code for DiscPlaces to display content, and take advantage of beaconing technology.</p>
<p>You can also clone the DiscPlaces mobile app, and customize it for your application. This entails choosing a name, icon, getting a Google Maps API key, a Disc API key, and picking the color schema. This gives you a mechanism to brand DiscPlaces for your own application.</p>
<p>If you do want to create custom content, e.g., for a museum, consider creating an indoor map of your museum. It’s fairly straightforward, though tedious. One of my students created one for his local HEB grocery store, check out his report <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOmzENeYRbZMZBJAQJ1oqI267LYB8oZkv3Iiy5pb-1s/edit#slide=id.g17531d2bd_074" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. You can read more about how you add an indoor map to Google maps <a href="https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/1711534?ref_topic=3100918&amp;p=gmm_guidelines&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

      <url>http://www.disc-app.com/discplaces-overview/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DiscPlaces is an app for hyperlocal search. It’s extremely simple: just a map overlaid with thumbnails of posts, and a searchbar on top. Search is contextual, i.e., search suggestions are based on what’s close to what you are searching for.  DiscPlaces is available as for IOS and Android.</p>
<p>Additional features include</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for indoor maps, i.e., showing posts for a single level of a building.</li>
<li>Very rich images in posts: images can be seen in summary views, gallery views, and map views</li>
<li>The ability to select places to search using suggestions</li>
<li>Memory of the last place searched for</li>
</ul>
<p>Content for DiscPlaces comes from the <a href="/discapp-overview">DiscApp</a>, which allows content creators to generate and edit rich content very easily using a web app or mobile app. DiscApp has particularly strong support for tagging posts, to further enhance search.</p>
<!-- DiscPlaces will become an open source app - it can be used standalone, or embedded into existing apps. For example, a retailer can embed DiscPlaces into their app, allowing them to give their customers the ability to find items in their store.  By using an API key we provide, the embedded DiscPlaces capability can be restricted to just the content created by a particular user or set of users. Read more about how you can customize DiscPlaces here [DiscApp](/discplaces-custom). -->
